# OOP Studies

In this app example, I used OOP to create three different types of Soldiers:
- Warriors
- Veterans
- Jedi
---
They all share the same properties and behaviors, they have:
- A name
- The ability to eat
- The ability to scratch dis nuts
- The ability to attack
---
- The name is set when we create the instance.
- The abilities "eat" and "scratch dis nuts" are the same for all of them.
- The ability "attack" is the only one that's different.
---
- The warrior can't fly and attacks with spades.
- The veteran can fly and attacks with guns.
- The jedi can fly and attacks with lasers.
---
## In this example I use:
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
---
## Print example
```
----- GET NAME -----
Tiago
Daniel
Diogo
----- GET CAN FLY -----
false
true
true
----- EAT ----------
Tiago is eating some ðŸ˜º
Daniel is eating some ðŸ˜º
Diogo is eating some ðŸ˜º
----- SCRATCH DIS NUTS -----
Tiago is scratching dis ðŸ¥œ
Daniel is scratching dis ðŸ¥œ
Diogo is scratching dis ðŸ¥œ
----- ATTACK -----
The warrior Tiago runs to the enemy and attacks by swinging his tiny dagger
The veteran Daniel gets his Desert Eagle, loads with his .50 bullets, aims at the enemy and shoots it perfectly
The jedi Diogo uses his power to fly super high in the sky and uses his laser to attack
----- PEASANT STUFF -----
Peasant is eating some ðŸ˜º
Peasant is scratching dis ðŸ¥œ
Peasant
